Bulldog

This repository was created for COS420 Object Oriented Programming at the Univerisity of Southern Maine. The programs in this repository are implemtations of the game Bulldog. 
There are two seperate implemntations in this repository, one was written by a large language model (details below) and the other by me. The purpose of creating two seperate versions of the game is to study the utility of LLMs in writing code. 

Human implementation:


LLM implementation:
Model: DeepSeek R1
Prompt: Could you implement this program? Here are the supplied classes: [I supplied the code listing for player.java, Prog6.java, and a PDF file of the assignment which I will not make public.]
Output: The model provided a working implementation of the game.
